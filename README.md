CompleX Studio is an very old project I've never finished.
Idea was to create an easy extendable IDE for any File Types. 

You can easially implement and Export own Editors, Designers, Options and more without affecting main IDE.
I worked on this for one year in 2010 And I never continued.

However maybe someone find this usefull or want to continue work on It.

For moving to github I changed Target Framework to .Net 4.8 and updated DevExpress references.

This Project uses DevExpress 21.1 what can be installed as trial from https://www.devexpress.com/
